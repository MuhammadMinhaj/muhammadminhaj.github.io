This project is a minimalist portfolio website that I both designed and implemented. The key aspects include:

- **UI/UX Design:** I crafted a clean, minimalist design focused on usability and aesthetics to effectively showcase my work and skills.

- **Implementation:** The website was built using Next.js and React.js, ensuring a seamless user experience with fast load times and efficient navigation.

- **Material-UI:** I utilized Material-UI for the styling, leveraging its components to maintain a consistent and modern design language throughout the site.
