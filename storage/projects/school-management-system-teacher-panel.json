  "description": "I've made School Management System (Website, Admin Panel, and Teacher Panel). This is a large project built by NodeJs and Ejs, as the database, I've used MongoDB and mongoose library. I spent a lot of time building this project, where I've created design templates and implemented them in coding. Full documentation and visualization of this project are coming soon.
