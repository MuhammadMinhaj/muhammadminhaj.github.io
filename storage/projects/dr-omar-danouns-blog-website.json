  "description": "### Project Overview\n\nThis project is comprised of three key components:\n\n- **Backend Development:** I crafted the backend using Express.js, Node.js, and Mongoose. This robust system handles efficient data management, secure authentication, and comprehensive API functionalities.\n\n- **Client-Side Interface:** The public-facing website, designed to publish medical-related articles, was developed with React.js, TailwindCSS, and Next.js. It features a sleek, modern, and responsive design, ensuring an engaging and user-friendly experience for content navigation.\n\n- **Admin Dashboard:** For the administrative interface, I implemented a versatile article management system. This dashboard supports content management, category and navigation organization, file uploads, newsletter subscriptions, and email notifications for new articles. Integrated authentication ensures secure access for administrators.\n\nOverall, this solution provides a seamless and intuitive experience for both visitors and administrators, effectively managing and showcasing medical content.",
