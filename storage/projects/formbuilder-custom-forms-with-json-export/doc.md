This freelance project involved creating a form builder website with both front-end and back-end components:

- **Front-End Development:** Designed and implemented the front-end UI using **Next.js** and **Material-UI**, featuring a clean and responsive design.
- **Back-End Development:** Built the backend with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Mongoose**, handling form data management and user interactions.
- **Layouts:** Two distinct layouts, Grid and Table View, for designing forms.
- **Categories:** Create forms for various purposes with categorized options.
- **Form Length:** Customizable form duration from 2 to 6 minutes.
- **Titles:** Set page titles and subtitles.
- **Question Types:** Includes 17 different question types such as number, matrix, phone, dropdown, select, short question, single select, file upload, signature, payment, and more.
- **Question Options:** Each question can be set as required or optional, with the ability to add more question types as needed.
- **Export/Import:** Export forms as JSON files, save to a database, and import form templates. Manage a list of created templates with options to copy, import, and manually handle JSON export/import. Thereâ€™s also an option to clear all templates.

The final output is a JSON file that serves as a versatile form template, usable for various form creation purposes. The project combines a well-designed front-end interface with a robust back-end infrastructure to deliver a functional and efficient form builder solution.
