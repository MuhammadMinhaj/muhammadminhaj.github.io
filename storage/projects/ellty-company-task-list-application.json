  "name": "Ellty Company Task List Application",
  "description": "### Project Overview\n\nThis assignment for Ellty Company involved developing a simple yet meticulously designed task list application with a focus on pixel-perfect UI/UX. The project includes the following components:\n\n- **Task List Functionality:** Users can select all tasks by marking 'All' and finalize their task list by clicking the 'Done' button. Alternatively, users can check specific tasks to complete them individually.\n\n- **Custom Checkbox Design:** The task list features custom checkboxes, which required detailed design and implementation. These checkboxes were designed with precision in Figma to ensure they matched the design specifications perfectly.\n\n- **Attention to Detail:** The project demanded a high level of attention to detail, ensuring every element was pixel-perfect and adhered to the design requirements.\n\n### Technologies Used\n\n- **React.js:** For building the dynamic user interface.\n- **TailwindCSS:** For styling and ensuring a modern, responsive design.\n- **Storybook:** For developing and testing UI components in isolation.\n\nOverall, this project showcases the ability to deliver high-quality, detailed UI/UX design in a functional and user-friendly task list application.",
