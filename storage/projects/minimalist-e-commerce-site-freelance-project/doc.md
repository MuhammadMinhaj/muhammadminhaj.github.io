This freelance project involved creating a minimal e-commerce platform with essential functionalities. Key features include:

- **Add to Cart Functionality:** Users can add items to their cart and adjust quantities as needed.
- **Product Rendering:** The site displays all products with a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **Animated Sidebar:** An animated sidebar enhances user interaction with hover effects.
- **Cost Calculation:** The platform calculates and displays the total cost and subtotals for individual products.

Developed using **TypeScript** and **Next.js**, this project serves as a testbed for e-commerce design concepts. It features core functionalities but is not intended as a fully functional commercial site.
